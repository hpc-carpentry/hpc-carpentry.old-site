Some of the HPC Carpentry team are very keen to bring HPC Carpentry into the carpentries as an
incubator project
([1]) and eventually become a member of the Carpentries (or the Carpentry Lab ([2]) at least). To start
this, they've proposed a breakout
session for carpentrycon at home ([3]) which will take place on July 20,
2020.

Besides sampling the community for expectations and hopes, we would love to propose a way forward
to bring the community
together and focus on hpc-intro ([4]). Key points of this are:

- propose a github manager who will coordinate reviews, reviewers and issues
- propose building a set of task forces to tackle particular issues, and asking for volunteers
- suggest to hold co-working hours (biweekly for 60-90 minutes via zoom) to establish continuous
  work on the material

With this message, we call for volunteers to help shape the session (we need at least 2 more people
since we plan to have 4
breakout rooms during the session). Please step forward and reply to the open issue in our repo
connected to the proposal ([5]) or to the proposal itself ([6]) or email us at
[maintainers-hpc@lists.carpentries.org](mailto:maintainers-hpc@lists.carpentries.org) (can you feel how keen we are to get you involved!).
