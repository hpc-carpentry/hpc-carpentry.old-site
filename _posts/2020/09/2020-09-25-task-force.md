In the fall of 2020, following successful engagement at the 
Carpentries@Home conference, a number of HPC Carpentry contributors got 
together and formed an "HPC Carpentry Task Force", with an expected
lifetime of about three months, with the goal of identifying and solving
the issues which stand between the current state of the lesson,
and incorporating our material into the mainstream Carpentries
infrastructure, though the [incubator][1] mechanism

An [initial meeting][2] was held on Sept. 16, 2020.

Moving forward, the plan is to coordinate several co-working
sessions where volunteers can identify and clear remaining
issues with the various repositories, and also to have 
higher-level coordination meetings, approximately monthly,
where issue priorities can be discussed, and tasks requiring
higher-level coordination can be undertaken.

Discussion and coordination takes place on the 
HPC Carpentry [Slack channel][3], The Carpentries' HPC
[mailing list][4], and through issues on the [coordination][5]
repository on Github.

All are welcome!
