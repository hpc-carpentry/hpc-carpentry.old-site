    <h1>HPC Carpentry:</br>Teaching basic skills for high-performance computing.</h1>
    <p>
    HPC Carpentry is a set of teaching materials designed to help new users take advantage of high-performance computing systems. 
    No prior computational experience is required - 
    these lessons are ideal for either an in-person workshop or independent study.
    </p>
    <b>NOTE: This is the draft HPC Carpentry release. Comments and feedback are welcome.</b>

<h2>What is HPC Carpentry?</h2>
<p>
Each of these lessons are designed to teach how to interact with a compute cluster in a specific way.
The first two lessons, <a href="https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/">Intro to HPC</a>, 
and <a href="https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-shell/">Shell on HPC</a> are meant to be 
used together as a general introduction to the bash command line and submitting jobs on a typical HPC cluster. 
The second two lessons focus on two separate use cases for HPC: 
running large numbers of compute jobs (often with complex inter-job dependencies),
or creating parallel programs that execute across one or more compute nodes.
Each lesson takes roughly a full day to teach (or work through independently).  It is 
intended that the Intro to HPC lesson be taught together with either the 
Python or Chapel component to form a two-day workshop or the Intro to HPC + Shell can 
be taught as a standalone.
